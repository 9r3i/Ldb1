This is embarrassing, i write this code at motivation for learning to get better and better only. Now, i myself see this code so old style and looks like weird, haha...

I have no API for this class, because this project is discontinued and replaced by Ldb2 --the 2nd generation of Ldb--, but i'm pretty sure you can figure it out how the API is.

If you wanna use this class, please remind the license. Thank you.
